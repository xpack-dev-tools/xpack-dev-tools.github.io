In October 2024, after some experimentation with modern site generators,
each project in the **xPack Binary Development Tools** collection now
has its own dedicated website.

<!--truncate-->

In addition, the collection itself
features a central site that serves as a table of contents, listing
all projects.

## MDX

In the world of documentation webs, the _new kid on the block_
is [MDX](https://mdxjs.com), a solution
to integrate [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) with
markdown.

The result is a static site (kind of), enhanced with lots of JavaScript
code, specific to [React](https://react.dev) components.

## Docusaurus

The tool used to generate the site is [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io),
a highly successful open source project maintained by Meta.
