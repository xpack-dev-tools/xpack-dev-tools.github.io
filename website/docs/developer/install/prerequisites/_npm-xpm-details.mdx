### node/npm

`npm` is included with Node.js and is required to install `xpm`.

For full details on installing Node.js, please refer to the
[xPack prerequisites](http://xpack.github.io/install/) page.

:::caution

Ensure you **do not** install npm with administrative rights,
such as via a system package manager. Instead, use `nvm` as
instructed to avoid permission-related issues.

### xpm

[`xpm`](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/) is a portable
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) command line application.

If you followed the _Quick instructions_, it is already installed.

Otherwise, to install it, follow the steps in the
[xpm install](http://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/) page.

If you are confident in your knowledge and prefer a shortcut,
issue the following command:"


```sh
npm install --global xpm@latest
```
