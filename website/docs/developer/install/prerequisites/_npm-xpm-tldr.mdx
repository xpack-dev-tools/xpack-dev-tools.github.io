## npm/xpm

### Quick instructions

If you are confident in your knowledge and prefer a shortcut, copy and
paste the following
[script](https://github.com/xpack/assets/blob/master/scripts/install-nvm-node-npm-xpm.sh)
into a terminal (otherwise, perform the steps one by one).

:::caution

For security reasons, conscientious users should first check
the content of the file before executing it.

:::

```sh
mkdir -pv "${HOME}/Downloads/"
curl --output "${HOME}/Downloads/install-nvm-node-npm-xpm.sh" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xpack/assets/master/scripts/install-nvm-node-npm-xpm.sh
cat "${HOME}/Downloads/install-nvm-node-npm-xpm.sh"

bash "${HOME}/Downloads/install-nvm-node-npm-xpm.sh"

exit
```

This script will install `nvm` (the Node Version Manager), `node`,
`npm` and `xpm`.

:::info

To activate `nvm` automatically,
the script adds several lines
to the shell initialisation script.
