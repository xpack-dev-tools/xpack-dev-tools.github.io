# Prerequisites for building xPack Binary Development Tools

The scripts utilised to build the
[xPack Binary Development Tools](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/)
are based on the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box) v5.1.0.

The build scripts run on **GNU/Linux** and **macOS**.

The **Windows** binaries are generated on x64 GNU/Linux,
using [mingw-w64](https://mingw-w64.org).

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

The macOS builds run natively on x64 and arm64
machines, and apart from the usual **Command Line Tools** (provided by
Apple) and `xpm`, the host machine has no other special
requirements.

The prerequisites are:

- `npm` (shipped with Node.js; installed via nvm)
- `xpm` (installed via `npm`)
- the **Command Line Tools** from Apple

Some build scripts may require **Python 3**. On modern systems, it should be
available in the standard Apple distribution. If not, install it from Python
[downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/).

For development builds, the procedure can be executed on a recent macOS
version (currently tested up to 14.6).

For production builds it is recommended to use a slightly older version,
for example **macOS 10.13** is a good compromise.

It is not mandatory to have a physical macOS 10.13 machine, a virtual
machine is also perfectly fine. Both Parallels and VirtualBox were
tested and found to be functional (although VirtualBox was not as
stable as Parallels).

The build scripts were tested on:

- macOS 14.6.1, running on an x64 MacMini
- macOS 12.6.8, running on an x64 MacMini
- macOS 10.14, running on a Intel NUC NUC8i7BEH
- macOS 10.13, running inside a Parallels virtual machine
- macOS 11.7.4, running on an Apple Silicon MacMini

When running on macOS this script also installs
the Command Line Tools.

## The Command Line Tools

The macOS compiler and other development tools are included in a
separate Xcode add-on. The best place to obtain it is from the
[Apple Developer Downloads](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/) site,
although this might require enrolling in the developer program
(free of charge).

If you followed the _Quick instructions_, CLT should be already installed.

Otherwise, the recommended method is to install the Command Line Tools
separately via the command line:

```console
% xcode-select --install
% xcode-select -p
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
$ gcc --version
Apple clang version 15.0.0 (clang-1500.3.9.4)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin23.6.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
```

:::info

Xcode alone includes the compiler
in the Xcode.app folder, which may vary in different versions;
for a stable configuration it is
necessary to install the CommandLineTools package.

## No macOS Docker

Due to the specifics of macOS, Docker cannot run natively; instead,
it uses a GNU/Linux virtual machine running in Apple HyperKit
(Apple's virtualization framework), and a file system compatibility
layer.

The end result is that Docker runs slowly, consumes a lot of memory,
and is not reliable, so it is not recommended to run the
Linux/Windows builds on macOS.

<TabItem value="linux" label="GNU/Linux">

The GNU/Linux build scripts use a set
of [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
images based on older
and more conservative distributions to avoid issues when
running the executables on older systems.

**Any x86_64/aarch64/armhf GNU/Linux distribution
capable of running Docker should suffice**; a physical machine is not
necessary, as virtual machines are
perfectly adequate. For optimal results, allocate 3-4 cores and 8-12 GB of RAM.

The XBB v5.0.0 Docker images are built on **Ubuntu 18 LTS** for both
x64 and Arm GNU/Linux, ensuring the resulting binaries can
run on any system based on **GLIBC >= 2.27**.

:::info

Building Arm binaries necessitates an Arm machine. A Raspberry
Pi 4 with 8GB of RAM, paired with a Samsung Portable T7 USB 3 SSD,
is an excellent solution. A Raspberry Pi 5 with an NVME SSD
is even better.

:::

:::info

Although Arm 32-bit binaries can be built inside Docker containers
running on AArch64 machines, it is still recommended to use a 32-bit
OS to avoid issues caused by the differences between armv7 and armv8.

:::

The prerequisites are:

- `curl` (installed via the system package manager)
- `git` (installed via the system package manager)
- `docker` (preferably a recent one, installed from **docker.com**)
- `npm` (shipped with Node.js; installed via **nvm**,
  **not** the system package manager)
- `xpm` (installed via `npm`)

The build scripts perform most of the actual work in a Docker container, and
apart from `curl`, `git` `docker` and `xpm`, the host machine has no other
special requirements.

The build scripts were tested on:

- Debian 11 (bullseye), running on an AMD Ryzen 5600G with 32 GB of RAM
- Debian 10 (buster), running on an AMD Ryzen 5600G with 32 GB of RAM
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, running on an Intel NUC NUC8i7BEH (i7) with 32 GB of RAM
- Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit, running on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8 GB of RAM
- Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit, running on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4 GB of RAM

## curl & git

Install `curl` & `git` using the system package manager.

For example on Ubuntu and Debian-derived distributions, use:

```sh
sudo apt-get install --yes curl git
```

## Docker

A **recent Docker** is necessary. it can probably be used, but it
is generally recommended to update to the latest stable version
available directly from docker.com.

For **any GNU/Linux** distribution, follow the
[specific instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository).

For example, the steps to install Docker on a modern **Ubuntu** system
are essentially:

```sh
sudo apt-get update && \
\
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg && \
\
sudo mkdir -m 0755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings && \
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg && \
\
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null && \
\
sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

To check if the install is functional, run the _Hello World_ image,
for the moment as `sudo`:

```console
$ sudo docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
b04784fba78d: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:f3b3b28a45160805bb16542c9531888519430e9e6d6ffc09d72261b0d26ff74f
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
...
```

### Configure Docker to run as a regular user

To allow Docker to run as a regular user, you need to be a member of
the `docker` group.

```sh
sudo groupadd docker
sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} docker

sudo service docker restart
```

The above commands are for Ubuntu and the Debian family. For other
distributions, the last line may differ. For example, for Arch Linux use:

```sh
systemctl restart docker
```

To make these changes effective, it is preferable to **reboot** the machine.

To check if the configuration change is functional, run the same
_Hello World_ image without sudo:

```console
$ docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker!
...
```

### Docker images

The Docker images are available from
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ilegeul/). They were build using
the Dockerfiles available from
[XBB (xPack Build Box)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box/tree/master/).

If not already loaded, Docker will load the images upon first usage.
The images are reasonably large, currently below 1 GB.

More details can be found on each script's documentation page.

## Visual Studio Code

Although not mandatory, VS Code is a valuable addition to the
development environment. With the
[xPack extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ilg-vscode.xpack),
some actions are just a mouse click away.
