**xPack Binary Development Tools** is a collection of standalone
cross-platform binary tools, aimed at reproducible builds.

The intended use case for the main tools is building and testing **C/C++
projects**, with an emphasis on **embedded projects**.

The supplementary tools were needed to build the main tools.
Since these tools are exclusively
built on macOS and GNU/Linux, to reduce maintenance efforts, for now
there are no Windows binaries. However, the projects are versatile and can be
used in any builds; if necessary, Windows binaries can be added in future
releases.

All projects are open source and are hosted in the GitHub Organization
[`xpack-dev-tools`](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/);
