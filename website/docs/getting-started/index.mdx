## Overview

**xPack Binary Development Tools** is a collection of standalone cross-platform binary tools, aimed at reproducible builds.



<details>
<summary>What are reproducible builds?</summary>

To be **reproducible**, an operation must remain stable over time and
across different environments. In other words, if builds are repeated
after some time, possibly on a different machine or platform, the
resulting behavior must be functionally equivalent.

</details>

<Overview/>



## xPacks

**xPacks** (short for **xpm packages**) are general-purpose,
language-neutral software packages.

<details>
<summary>What the heck are xPacks? Please, do not introduce another package format!</summary>

While the initial appearance may seem complex, utilizing xPacks
(xpm packages) is, in fact, straightforward.
The design rationale is to automate frequent
operations that occur during software development, in this case the
installation of
dependencies, and to ensure reproducibility.

xPacks are managed by **[xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/)**
(the xPack Project Manager),
a program that complements the **[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/)** CLI
(the popular JavaScript package manager), with new language-neutral features.

The xPacks Framework **does NOT introduce a new package format**; instead,
it uses **the same format as npm packages**, which is a collection of
files/folders and a `package.json` file with the package metadata.

**xpm** can install packages from the
same repositories as **npm**, whether public or private.

The packages (usually regular archives, but also git repositories),
are extracted into separate folders within the project.

Based on the content, there are two types of packets:

- **source xPacks** (that install source files, usually libraries) and
- **binary xPacks** (that install executables/binary files, usually tools).

The binary xPacks include references to archives with the platform specific
binaries (such as `.tar.gz` for Unix or `.zip` for Windows).

These archives are also expanded along the package metadata. Since they
include executables, links/forwarders to
these executables are created in a `.bin` folder,
eliminating the need to add multiple folders to the `PATH`.

Given that some binary xPacks, such as toolchains, can have very large
archives, the packages are extracted only once into a user global location to
conserve space. In projects, instead of duplicating the content of these
archives, symbolic links are created.

Simply put, xPacks can be used to further automate the installation of source
libraries and tools.

</details>

## Features

All binaries are:

- **self-contained** (include all required libraries)
- **file-system relocatable** (can be installed in any location)
- built on slightly older systems (to make them run on both old and new systems)

<details>
<summary>Compatibility with older systems</summary>

Given that most operating systems maintain significant compatibility
with older versions, building an application on an older system ensures
that the same binary can run on newer versions. Conversely, building an
application on a newer system may utilize library features that are
not available in older versions, making backward compatibility less
feasible.

</details>

## Benefits

The main advantages of using the **xPack Binary Development Tools** are:

- a convenient, uniform and portable install/uninstall/upgrade
procedure; the same procedure is used for all major
  platforms (**x64 Windows**, **x64 macOS**, **arm64 macOS**, **x64 GNU/Linux**, **arm64 GNU/Linux**, **arm GNU/Linux**)
- multiple versions of the same package can be installed at the same time on
  the same system
- no need to worry about dependent libraries, they are all included
- significantly lighter and easier to use than Docker images that provide
  similar functionality and are GNU/Linux centric
- projects can be tied to specific tools versions; this provides a good
  reproducibility, especially useful in **CI/CD** environments.

## Install

The executables and other related files can be installed automatically with
**xpm** or manually by downloading the
**platform specific archives**.

The details of installing the various **xPack Binary Development Tools**
on various platforms are presented in the
**Install Guide** of each project web site.
