# The xPack Binary Development Tools

There are several tools, grouped by their expected use.

## Main tools

The intended use case for the **main tools** is building and testing **C/C++
projects**, with an emphasis on **embedded projects**, but native projects
can benefit as well.

### Toolchains

The core tools are the toolchains. There are two Arm Embedded GCC toolchains,
one for 32-bit devices (`arm-none-eabi-gcc`) and one for 64-bit devices
(`aarch64-none-elf-gcc`). The second supported embedded architecture is
RISC-V, with the `riscv-none-elf-gcc` toolchain that generates both 32 and
64-bit executables.

For native builds, the two main toolchains (`gcc` and `clang`) are supported.

To cross-build Windows projects, the `mingw-w64-gcc` toolchain is included.

### Build tools

The main system build generators (`cmake` and `meson`) are supported.

As a modern replacement to make, the `ninja` small build system is included.

### Emulators

To test the Arm and RISC-V executables, the `qemu-system-arm`,
`qemu-system-aarch64` and `qemu-system-riscv` emulators are supported.

### OpenOCD

To flash and debug bare metal boards, the `openocd` on-chip debugger
is incuded.

## Supplementary tools

The **supplementary tools** were needed to build the main tools.
Since these tools are exclusively
built on macOS and GNU/Linux, to reduce maintenance efforts, currently
there are no Windows binaries. However, the projects are versatile and can be
used in any builds; if necessary, Windows binaries can be added in future
releases.

The `bison`, `flex`, `m4`, `patchelf`, `pkg-config`, `realpath`, `sed`,
`wine` are provided.

## Work in progress

Some projects are not yet production ready, and need some more work.

## Common internal projects

### The xPack Build Box (XBB)

For reproducibility, the GNU/Linux builds, also used
to build the Windows binaries, are based on several Docker images.

The scripts to create these Docker images are hosted in a separate project.

### The xPack Build Box Helper

The build procedures for all projects have many things
in common; to avoid code duplication, the common scripts and
other resources were grouped in a helper project.
